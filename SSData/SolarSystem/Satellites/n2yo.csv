22,"EXPLORER 7",,US,"EXPLORER 7 was designed to measure solar X-ray and Lyman-alpha flux, trapped energetic particles, and heavy primary cosmic rays (Z>5). Secondary objectives included collecting data on micrometeoroid penetration and molecular sputtering and studying the earth-atmosphere heat balance. The spin-stabilized satellite's external structure consisted of two truncated conical fiberglass shells joined by a cylindrical aluminum center section. The spacecraft was 75 cm wide at its equator and about 75 cm high. The spacecraft was powered by approximately 3000 solar cells mounted on both the upper and lower shells. Additional power was provided by 15 nickel-cadmium batteries that were positioned on its equator near the outer skin as an aid in maintaining a proper spin rate. Two crossed dipole (1 W, 20 MHz) telemetry antennas projected outward from the center section, and a 108-MHz antenna used for tracking was mounted on the bottom of the lower shell. Located around the periphery of the center section were five bolometers for thermal radiation measurements and three cadmium sulfide micrometeoroid detector cells. A cylindrical ion chamber (lithium flourid window) and a beryllium window X-ray chamber were located on opposite sides of the upper cone, and a cosmic-ray Geiger counter was located on the very top. A primary cosmic-ray ionization chamber was located within the center portion of the upper cone. Useful real-time data were transmitted from launch through February 1961 and intermittently until August 24, 1961.",AFETR,1959-10-13,0000-00-00

One was slightly smaller than the other. A monopole transmitting antenna about 60 cm long extended from the center of the convex surface of the larger square. Reflective striping was applied for temperature control. This satellite was made by volunteer effort of a group of amateur radio operators and was launched as ballast on an AF launch vehicle. The spacecraft was battery operated and had no attitude control system.",AFWTR,1961-12-12,1962-01-31

Telstar 2 differed from Telstar 1 by employing provisions for scientific information to be transmitted in real time via the microwave telemetry system so that telemetry could be obtained after the 2-yr timer had turned off the VHF beacon. On May 16, 1965, at 1403 UT, during the satellite's 4736 orbit, the VHF transmitter was turned off. All systems operated normally until that time.",AFETR,1963-05-07,0000-00-00

746,"ELEKTRON 1",,CIS,"Electron 1 was launched with Electron 2 by a single launch vehicle in order to perform simultaneous investigations of the external and internal zones of the Earth's radiation belt. Electron 1 had a cylindrical body that was 0.75 m in diameter and 1.3 m long and from which antennas and six solar cell panels were extended. The spacecraft was placed into an eccentric orbit that enabled it to study the internal zone of the radiation belt. It was equipped with micrometeorite detectors, a mass spectrometer, a proton detector, and instruments for recording the corpuscular emission and energy spectrum of electrons. A memory device was included so that observations over several orbits could be obtained by USSR telemetry stations when the satellite was within communications range.",TTMTR,1964-01-30,0000-00-00

It contained liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks and a J2 engine. It was launched into Earth orbit attached to the Command and Service Module (CSM). The SIVB provided the thrust to take the CSM from Earth orbit into a lunar transfer orbit. After achieving trajectory towards the Moon, the Apollo 8 CSM decoupled from the SIVB at 16:12 UT on 21 December 1968 and made a course correction to head for lunar orbit. The SIVB stage was put on a trajectory to fly by the Moon on 24 December after which it entered solar orbit.",AFETR,1968-12-21,0000-00-00

The SIVB consisted of a truncated cone with a bottom diameter of 10.06 m topped by a long cylinder with a diameter of 6.60 m. Total height was 17.80 m. It contained liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks and a J2 engine. It was launched into Earth orbit attached to the Command, Service, and Lunar Modules (CSM and LM). For lunar missions the SIVB provided the thrust to take the CSM and LM from Earth orbit into a lunar transfer orbit. The CSM and LM on this mission were left in Earth orbit for rendezvous and docking practice. On 3 March 1969 the S-IVB stage made a third burn to put it into a solar orbit.",AFETR,1969-03-03,0000-00-00

4226,"SATURN 5 R/B",RB,US,"The Apollo Saturn V SIVB was the third stage of the Saturn V booster. The SIVB consisted of a truncated cone with a bottom diameter of 10.06 m topped by a long cylinder with a diameter of 6.60 m. Total height was 17.80 m. It contained liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks and a J2 engine. It was launched into Earth orbit attached to the Command, Service, and Lunar Modules (CSM and LM). The SIVB provided the thrust to take the CSM and LM from Earth orbit into a lunar transfer orbit. After achieving trajectory towards the Moon, the LM and CSM decoupled from the SIVB at 20:35 UT on 14 November 1969 and made a course correction to head for lunar orbit. Propellants were fired to target the SIVB stage past the Moon and into solar orbit, but the stage did not go close enough to the Moon to permit escape, and it ended in a highly elliptical Earth orbit.",AFETR,1969-11-14,0000-00-00

4382,DFH-1,,PRC,"This DFH (Dong Fang Hong - Red is East) Chinese communications satellite contained a radio transmitter. It was the first Chinese experimental satellite launched by a LM-1 booster into a 441 x 2286 km orbit inclined at 68.4 deg. from a launch facility near Lop Nor. The primary satellite mission was to broadcast the song ""Dong Fang Hong"", paying tribute to Chairman Mao, and to announce the time. The satellite was spherically shaped with a one meter diameter. It ceased transmitting in June 1970. This was the first satellite launched by China on its own booster, making China the fifth nation to put a spacecraft into orbit using its own rocket.",JSC,1970-04-24,0000-00-00

5377,"APOLLO 15 (IRW PL)",,US,"The Apollo 15 subsatellite (PFS-1) was a small satellite released into lunar orbit from the Apollo 15 Service Module. Its main objectives were to study the plasma, particle, and magnetic field environment of the Moon and map the lunar gravity field. Specifically it measured plasma and energetic particle intensities and vector magnetic fields, and facilitated tracking of the satellite velocity to high precision. A basic requirement was that the satellite acquire fields and particle data everywhere on the orbit around the Moon. A virtually identical subsatellite was also deployed by Apollo 16. The Moon's roughly circular orbit about the Earth at ~380000 km (60 Earth radii) carried the subsatellite into both interplanetary space and various regions of the Earth's magnetosphere. The satellite orbited the Moon and returned data from 4 August 1971 until January 1973. The exact date and place of decay are unknown.",AFETR,1971-07-26,0000-00-00

5580,"PROSPERO (BLACK ARROW)",,UK,"Prospero was a British scientific satellite launched from the Woomera site in Australia aboard a Black Arrow rocket. It was used to test equipment for future satellites and to conduct a scientific experiment to measure the incidence of micrometeoroids. It had an external shape similar to a pumpkin, with an equatorial diameter of 1.2 m and a height of 0.7 m. Its anticipated life was 100 years. This launch made the United Kingdom the sixth nation to put a satellite into orbit on its own rocket.",WOMRA,1971-10-28,0000-00-00

12504,"COSMOS 1275",,CIS,"Cosmos 1275 was part of a 6-satellite Soviet military navigation system distributed in orbital planes spaced 30 degrees apart, and launched from the Plesetsk cosmodrome aboard a Cosmos rocket. Navigation information was derived from Doppler-shifted VHF transmissions (approximately 150 and 400 MHz) of the satellite position and orbital data. By acquiring fixes from several satellite, a user's location could be calculated with an accuracy of 100 m. The time needed to ascertain a position was dependent upon the user's latitude and the number of operational spacecraft in orbit. Normally, accurate location determination could be made within 1-2 hours.",PKMTR,1981-06-04,0000-00-00

12645,"INTERCOSMOS 22 (BULGARIA 1300)",,BGR,"INTERKOSMOS 22, more commonly known as Bulgaria 1300, is the first artificial satellite of Bulgaria. The satellite was developed by the Bulgarian Space Agency around the ""Meteor"" bus, provided by the Soviet Union as part of the Interkosmos program. Assembly took place in Bulgaria, and the spacecraft was launched from Plesetsk in 13:35 local time on 7 August, 1981. During that same year the Bulgarian government organized a massive celebration to commemorate the 1300th anniversary of the country's founding. Interkosmos 22 was successfully inserted in a near-Polar orbit. The outer skin of the spacecraft, including the solar panels, is coated with a conducting material in order to allow the proper measurement of electric fields and low energy plasma. Power is provided by the two solar panels, which generate 2 kW of electricity. A rechargeable battery pack is used as an energy supply when the spacecraft is in an eclipse period. Gathered data is stored on two tape recorders, each with a capacity of 60 megabits. The main transmitter radiates 10 W in the 130-MHz band. No operational limit was planned. As of 2009, the satellite is operational and still on BSA's list of active programs, and provides data about the extreterrestrial environment over Earth's polar regions.",PKMTR,1981-08-07,0000-00-00

13818,"COSMOS 1441",,CIS,"COSMOS 1441 was a Soviet ELINT (Electronic and Signals Intelligence). From 1965 to 1967 two dedicated ELINT systems were tested: the Tselina and the Navy's US. Both reached service, since the Ministry of Defence could not force a single system on the military services. Tselina was developed by Yuzhnoye and consisted of two satellites: Tselina-O for general observations and Tselina-D for detailed observations. ELINT systems for Tselina were first tested under the Cosmos designation in 1962 to 1965. The first Tselina-O was launched in 1970. The Tselina-D took a long time to enter service due to delays in payload development and weight growth. The whole Tselina system was not operational until 1976. Constant improvement resulted in Tselina-O being abandoned in 1984 and all systems being put on Tselina-D.",PKMTR,1983-02-16,2014-11-08

16609,MIR,,CIS,"Mir was a highly successful Soviet (and later Russian) space station. It was humanity's first consistently inhabited long-term research station in space. Through a number of collaborations, it was made internationally accessible to cosmonauts and astronauts of many different countries. Mir was assembled in orbit by successively connecting several modules, each launched separately from February 19, 1986 to 1996. The station existed until March 23, 2001, at which point it was deliberately de-orbited and broke apart during atmospheric re-entry.",TTMTR,1986-02-19,2001-03-23

Commercial Low-Earth orbit satellites typically have a lifetime of just a few years.     The long lifetime of Amateur Satellites is one reason why the Amateur Satellite Service needs the assurance of access to low-noise floor spectrum for several decades after a satellite is launched.

22675,"COSMOS 2251",,CIS,"The lowest level of the three-tier communications satellite constellation is now populated with two distinct systems devoted to military and government communications. Both systems are assessed to be simple store-dump repeaters which were particularly useful in relaying non-essential traffic between the Russian Federation and overseas stations of forces. The first Strela (which means ""Arrow"" in Russian) system debuted in 1970 and consisted of 750-1000 kg satellites deployed at mean altitudes of 800 km in three orbital planes inclined 74 degrees to the equator and spaced 120 degrees apart. These Strela 2 spacecraft were launched separately by the Kosmos launch vehicle from the Plesetsk cosmodrome into each orbital plane at intervals of 24-36 months. The activity of these satellites could be monitored via a characteristic CW beacon emitted on a frequency of 153.660 MHz.   On 10 February 2009 at approximately 16:56 UT the Cosmos 2251 satellite collided with Iridium 33 (1997-051C). The collision took place at about 800 km altitude. <br><br>",PKMTR,1993-06-16,0000-00-00

22825,EYESAT-1,,SKOR,"EYESAT-1 (AO-27) is an amateur satellite constructed by the Amateur Radio Research and Development Corporation (AMRAD) at the facilities of Interferometrics in McLean, Virginia. It was originally designed as a commercial satellite known as EYESAT-1 but its completion was halted part way through the project. An agreement was made for AMRAD to finish the construction of the satellite and add an amateur satellite transponder. AO-27 is an “FM Repeater” in space. It essentially consists of a crystal controlled FM receiver operation at 145.850 MHz and a crystal controlled FM transmitter operating at approximately 436.795 MHz. Output power of the transmitter can be set to over 1 watt (rarely used), 0.5 watts (normal operation), or under 0.1 watts (exciter only). The uplink antenna is the linear polarized whip on the top face of the spacecraft and is shared with the commercial payload’s receivers. The downlink antenna is a 1/4 wave whip mounted on the bottom face of the spacecraft. Polarization is nominally linear, the rotation and revolution of the spacecraft and propagation effects will cause the actual signal polarization at a ground station to vary widely during a pass.",FRGUI,1993-09-26,0000-00-00

23439,"RADIO ROSTO",,CIS,"RADIO ROSTO is the fifteenth Russian amateur radio spacecraft. ROSTO is an acronym for Russian Defence, Sports, and Technical Organization. The initial orbit was 2165 x 1885 km, with an inclination of 64.6 deg. The 70-kg micro-satellite carries linear communications transponders. It is spherical in shape and about 1 m in diameter. The onboard electronics equipment was designed and built by a group of radio amateurs from Kaluga, a town 180 km SW of Moscow. Radio-ROSTO was seen as the precursor to a proposed constellation of Radio-M spacecraft. Also launched by Rokot but into orbits of 950 - 1,000 km at 65 degrees, the network would consist of up to 6 spacecraft working with uplink and downlink frequencies of 435 MHz and 146 MHz and an output transmitter power of 20 W. Radio M spacecraft will be nearly twice as massive with a total mass of 120 kg. An alternative system would consist of six Radio-ROSTO class spacecraft in circular orbits near 1,950 km at inclinations of 65 degrees.",TTMTR,1994-12-26,0000-00-00

Navigation information was derived from Doppler-shifted VHF transmissions (approximately 150 and 400 MHz) of the satellite position and orbital data. By acquiring fixes from several satellite, a user's location could be calculated with an accuracy of 100 m. The time needed to ascertain a position was dependent upon the user's latitude and the number of operational spacecraft in orbit. Normally, accurate location determination could be made within 1-2 hours.",PKMTR,1997-09-23,0000-00-00

The name ""TERRA"" comes from the Latin word for Earth. The satellite was placed into a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 705 km, with a 10:30am descending node. TERRA carries a payload of five remote sensors designed to monitor the state of Earth's environment and ongoing changes in its climate system: ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer); CERES (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System); MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer); MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer); MOPITT (Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere). Data from the satellite helps scientists better understand the spread of pollution around the globe. Studies have used instruments on TERRA to examine trends in global carbon monoxide and aerosol pollution. The data collected by TERRA will ultimately become a new, 15-year global data set.",AFWTR,1999-12-18,0000-00-00

Thus, first transmit an initial carrier with a PL tone of 74.4 to arm the timer.     The repeater consists of a miniature VHF receiver with sensitivity of -124dBm, having an IF bandwidth of 15 kHz. The receive antenna is a 1/4 wave vertical mounted in the top corner of the spacecraft.

The 4.7 tonne spacecraft will provide data-relay among installations in North America, South America, Western Europe and Africa through its array of C- and K-band transponders after parking over 27.5 deg-W longitude. It replaces the aging Intelsat 605. This was the last and 116th launch of the Ariane-4 series which will be replaced by the Ariane-5 series.",FRGUI,2003-02-15,0000-00-00

It is a highly classified spacecraft, owned and operated by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). No further details are available. In January 2008, reports emerged that a U.S. spy satellite, again probably this one, was in a deteriorating orbit, and that the object was expected to crash into the Earth within weeks. Early reports indicated that the satellite could contain ""hazardous materials"", probably hydrazine, and possibly beryllium,though there was also some speculation that the satellite might have a ""nuclear"" power core, i.e. a radioisotope thermoelectric generator. Defense consultant John E. Pike dismissed this as ""unlikely"". (according to Wikipedia) On January 29, 2008, an Associated Press story quoted a U.S. Air Force general as saying that contingency plans were being made since intact pieces of the satellite ""might re-enter into the North American area"".  At about 10:26 p.m. EST, a U.S. Navy Aegis warship, the USS Lake Erie, fired a single modified tactical Standard Missile 3, hitting the satellite about 133 nautical miles over the Pacific Ocean as it traveled in space at more than 17,000 mph, according to a Defense Department statement. The objective was to rupture the fuel tank to dissipate the roughly 1,000 pounds of hydrazine, a hazardous fuel that could pose a danger to people on Earth.",AFWTR,2006-12-14,2008-02-29

Launch took place at 1:26 PDT. Launch operations at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California ran smoothly, with no technical or weather issues causing concern. The AIM mission is the first dedicated to exploring mysterious ice clouds that dot the edge of space in Earth's polar regions. These clouds have grown brighter and more prevalent in recent years and some scientists suggest that changes in these clouds may be the result of climate change.",WRAS,2007-04-25,0000-00-00

Nicknamed Kizuna, the 10,692-pound satellite was expected to be released in an orbit with a high point of 22,354 miles and a low point of 155 miles. The geosynchronous transfer orbit should have an inclination of 28.5 degrees, according to prelaunch estimates. Kizuna will use its own propulsion module to gradually boost its orbit to an altitude of approximately 22,300 miles and reduce its inclination to zero degrees to enter geosynchronous orbit, where the craft's velocity will match the speed of Earth's rotation. Kizuna will be permanently parked above the equator at 143 degrees east longitude, or above the Pacific Ocean north of New Guinea.",TNSTA,2008-02-23,0000-00-00

The broad spectrum, which includes X-rays, will allow scientists to study the energy produced by solar flares, sudden violent explosions that unleash magnetic energy and accelerate charged particles to nearly the speed of light. The observatory's instruments, provided by Russian, Indian and Ukrainian scientists, will analyze the mysterious causes of solar flares. The sensors will also capture high-resolution images of the sun at least every few minutes, giving scientists a detailed view of solar flare development.",PKMTR,2009-01-30,0000-00-00

The orbit crosses the equator from south to north at 2 p.m. on the trips around the planet. NOAA-N Prime is outfitted with instruments that provide imagery, atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles, and land and ocean surface temperature observations, all of which are key ingredients for weather forecasting. In addition, the information generates decades-long databases for climate monitoring and global change studies. In addition, the NOAA satellites are equipped with search and rescue packages that detect distress signals from emergency beacons.

Mission specialists rounding out the crew are: veteran spacewalkers John Grunsfeld and Mike Massimino, and first-time space fliers Andrew Feustel, Michael Good and Megan McArthur. During the 11-day mission's five spacewalks, astronauts will install two new instruments, repair two inactive ones and perform the component replacements that will keep the telescope functioning into at least 2014. In addition to the originally scheduled work, Atlantis also will carry a replacement Science Instrument Command and Data Handling Unit for Hubble. Astronauts will install the unit on the telescope, removing the one that stopped working on Sept. 27, 2008, delaying the servicing mission until the replacement was ready.",AFETR,2009-05-11,2009-05-24

The probe will remain in constant view over the White Sands ground station throughout its mission. Officials selected the orbit to maximize SDO's data return and minimize the time the satellite will spend in Earth's shadow, when the sun would be blocked from view. The satellite's three instruments will take rapid-fire images of the sun, peer into the solar interior and measure its extreme ultraviolet radiation output. SDO will return gargantuan volumes of data during its mission, beaming the information to dedicated antennas at White Sands, N.M. The sensors will send up to 150 million bits of data per second, almost 50 times more science data than any other mission in NASA history.",AFETR,2010-02-11,0000-00-00

AEHF was envisioned to keep communications flowing between the military and civilian leadership in any extreme wartime environment, giving the U.S. information superiority. Communications relayed through AEHF can include critical support to Special Operations, situational awareness for Army troops, giving last-minute targeting information to en-route Air Force fighters and transmitting Tomahawk missile updates to the Navy. For the nation's nuclear forces, these hardened satellites would be the communications lifeline for crisis response and war planning in the most dire circumstances imaginable.",AFETR,2010-08-14,0000-00-00

37158,"QZS-1 (MICHIBIKI)",,JPN,"QZS-1 (MICHIBIKI) is the first of three planned satellites to fill coverage gaps from U.S. Global Positioning System satellites caused by signal blockage from mountains and skyscrapers. Developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and four government ministries, the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System is aimed at overcoming ground interference by launching more navigation satellites strategically positioned high in the sky above Asia. The line-of-sight navigation signals from GPS satellites can be interrupted in rural hamlets and skyscraper-filled cities like Tokyo, where users occasionally lack sufficient data to determine their position, elevation and time. JAXA says a constellation of three QZSS spacecraft would make three-dimensional navigation coverage available 99.8 percent of the time, an improvement over the estimated 90 percent availability with GPS satellites today. MICHIBIKI will circle the Earth at a 45-degree angle to the equator. Its orbital high point will be more than 24,000 miles (38,600 km) over the northern hemisphere and its lowest altitude will be 20,500 miles (33,000 km), according to JAXA. Projected against Earth's surface, MICHIBIKI's ground track will chart an asymmetric figure-eight pattern stretching from Japan to Australia as it alternates north and south of the equator.",TNSTA,2010-09-11,0000-00-00

Telstar 14, also called Estrela do Sul 1, launched in 2004 but was stricken when its north solar array also failed to fully deploy in space. Telstar 14 has been operating only a fraction of its communications payload since then, and Telesat ordered Telstar 14R to replace and expand service from its orbital location in geostationary orbit at 63 degrees west longitude. Telesat expected Telstar 14R would more than double the communications capacity of Telstar 14. With five beams and 46 Ku-band transponders, Telstar 14R's coverage was to be focused on Brazil, with additional coverage of the Atlantic Ocean, the Andean region and Central America, the southern cone of South America and the continental United States.",TTMTR,2011-05-20,0000-00-00

The Indian Space Research Organization, or ISRO, developed the satellite to help emergency officials respond to disasters like floods and cyclones. RISAT 1 will also monitor crops during India's monsoon season, according to ISRO. Indian defense officials could also use RISAT 1 to eavesdrop on the country's fractious border regions and neighboring countries. The RISAT 1 spacecraft's C-band radar will see through clouds and take pictures of the ground at night, offering a significant leap in technology and reconnaissance data over existing optical imagers. Because they do not require sunlight to illuminate the ground, radar pulses emitted from orbiting satellites can resolve objects on Earth's surface in darkness and in all weather conditions.",SRI,2012-04-26,0000-00-00

Initiated internally by SpaceX in 2005, the Dragon spacecraft is made up of a pressurized capsule and unpressurized trunk used for Earth to LEO transport of pressurized cargo, unpressurized cargo, and/or crew members. The Dragon spacecraft is comprised of 3 main elements: the Nosecone, which protects the vessel and the docking adaptor during ascent; the Spacecraft, which houses the crew and/or pressurized cargo as well as the service section containing avionics, the RCS system, parachutes, and other support infrastructure; and the Trunk, which provides for the stowage of unpressurized cargo and will support Dragon’s solar arrays and thermal radiators. Though designed to address cargo and crew requirements for the ISS, as a free-flying spacecraft Dragon also provides an excellent platform for in-space technology demonstrations and scientific instrument testing. SpaceX is currently manifesting fully commercial, non-ISS Dragon flights under the name “DragonLab”.

38551,"ECHOSTAR 17",,US,"ECHOSTAR 17, built by Space Systems/Loral, will expand high-speed broadband Internet capacity over North America for the HughesNet service operated by Hughes Network Systems, a subsidiary of EchoStar Corp. The satellite deployed its two solar array wings after separating from the Ariane 5 rocket, according to a statement released by Space Systems/Loral. EchoStar 17 did not succumb to a glitch which caused permanent damage on the similar Intelsat 19 satellite, but engineers investigating the problem are focusing on an anamoly observed during its launch on a Sea Launch Zenit 3SL booster. Previously named Jupiter 1, the EchoStar 17 satellite has capacity for more than 100 gigabits per second to enhance HughesNet service over the United States and Canada. EchoStar 17 will provide high-speed Internet access to nearly 2 million additional customers. EchoStar 17 launched with a mass of about 13,448 pounds (6,100 kg), and it features 60 Ka-band communications beams. The craft will be stationed in geosynchronous orbit at 107 degrees west longitude.",FRGUI,2012-07-05,0000-00-00

MSG 3 will collect highly-detailed imagery of Europe, the North Atlantic, and Africa every 15 minutes for use by weather forecasters. The 4,486-pound (2,035-kg) satellite will operate for at least 7 years, and it will be renamed Meteosat 10 when it enters service. It will replace Meteosat 8, which launched in 2002 and has surpassed its design life, according to Sergio Rota, head of geostationary satellite programs at Eumetsat. Rota said Meteosat 10 will enter service at the beginning of 2013, assuming responsibility for full-disk imaging of Earth in a zone stretching from the North Pole to the South Pole and from Chile to India. Meteosat 9—launched in 2005—will take over rapid-scan services, collecting data every 5 minutes in a specific region over Europe.",FRGUI,2012-07-05,0000-00-00

TJ3Sat's primary mission is to provide educational resources to other K-12 education institutions to foster interest in aerospace through the successful design and flight of a CubeSat. The primary payload of TJ3Sat gives the students and other amateur radio users the opportunity to send and receive data from the satellite. Onboard the satellite a Text Speak module is used to convert text messages into an analog voice signal. Students and other users from around the world can submit text strings to be uploaded to the TJ3Sat website. Approved text strings will be transmitted to the satellite and the resulting voice interpretation will be relayed back to Earth over an amateur radio frequency using the onboard Stensat radio. In addition to the voice signals, properly outfitted amateur radio stations can receive state of health telemetry from the satellite.

The Soyuz is to remain docked to the space station to serve as an emergency escape vehicle until TMA-12M's scheduled return to Earth in September 2014. After a successful launch on 25 March, docking was scheduled to occur on 26 March via the relatively new six-hour duration orbital trajectory. In the event, one of the orbital burns scheduled to refine the trajectory did not occur as planned, due to an attitude control problem in which the spacecraft was incorrectly oriented. The rendezvous phase was subsequently replanned to the formerly-used two-day trajectory. Accordingly, TMA-12M arrived at the ISS on 27 March.",TTMTR,2014-03-25,2014-09-11

Japan lost the ALOS mission just six weeks after it was tasked with observing damage in the aftermath of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that ravaged the Japanese coastline north of Tokyo, killing thousands and triggering the crisis Fukushima nuclear power plant. The first ALOS satellite carried an optical stereo camera system, a radiometer and an L-band radar, combining the sensors aboard a single spacecraft. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency decided to launch the follow-up ALOS 2 satellite with an enhanced version of the L-band radar carried aboard the first mission.

40059,"OCO 2",,US,"OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2) is an American environmental science satellite, a replacement for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory which was lost in a launch failure in 2009. The OCO-2 satellite was built by Orbital Sciences Corporation, based around the LEOStar-2 bus. The spacecraft will be used to study carbon dioxide concentrations and distributions in the atmosphere. OCO-2 was ordered after the original OCO spacecraft failed to achieve orbit. During the first satellite's launch atop a Taurus-XL in February 2009, the payload fairing failed to separate from around the spacecraft and the rocket did not have sufficient power to enter orbit with its additional mass. Although a Taurus launch was initially contracted for the reflight, the launch contract was cancelled after the same malfunction occurred on the launch of the Glory satellite two years later. OCO-2 joined the A-train satellite constellation, becoming the sixth satellite in the group. Members of the A-train fly very close together in sun-synchronous orbit, to make nearly simultaneous measurements of Earth.

The MUOS satellite No. 3, set to become the Atlantic Ocean regional satellite, takes the next step to assemble a worldwide communications system using 3G-cellular technology for ships, submarines, aircraft, land vehicles and terminals in the hands of troops. The new system offers more bandwidth on demand, better voice quality, simultaneous voice and data and better connectivity on the move in remote locations, under weather, in urban environments than ever before. Users will include the four branches of military, government agencies, border patrol and the president. From its eventual spot in geosynchronous orbit, a parking spot 22,300 miles (35,888 km) up, the expansive footprint of MUOS 3 will cover nearly a third of the planet. MUOS serves a dual-provider of both voice traffic currently routed by the Navy's existing generation, albeit aging, Ultra High Frequency Follow-On spacecraft, but it also creates a new era of mobile communications built around 3G cellular technology to relay narrowband tactical information such as calls, data messaging, file transfers and email on rates of up to 384 Kilobits per second.",AFETR,2015-01-21,0000-00-00

SMAP's combined radar and radiometer instruments will peer into the top 2 inches (5 centimeters) of soil, through clouds and moderate vegetation cover, day and night, to produce the highest-resolution, most accurate soil moisture maps ever obtained from space. SMAP is projected to last for at least a three year primary mission.  SMAP will provide high-resolution, space-based measurements of soil moisture and its state—frozen or thawed—a new capability that will allow scientists to better predict natural hazards of extreme weather, climate change, floods and droughts, and help reduce uncertainties in our understanding of Earth's water, energy and carbon cycles, according to a NASA description. The mission will map the entire globe every two to three days for at least three years and provide the most accurate and highest-resolution maps of soil moisture ever obtained.

The infrared camera on Kompsat 3A is a first for South Korea's Earth observation satellites. It will create thermal imagery, making it possible for analysts to see the ground at night with a resolution of 18 feet (5.5 meters), a capability suited for detecting wildfires and volcanic eruptions. KARI has partnered with commercial companies to sell Kompsat imagery to global customers. Kompsat 3A is the fifth satellite in the Kompsat series to fly since the first one launched in 1999.

However, Russian flight controllers initially could not confirm the health of the spacecraft's systems and deployment of Kurs rendezvous and other navigational antennas. They selected the backup rendezvous plan with a targeted arrival Thursday for the cargo ship and its supplies for the  space station crew. The Progress spacecraft is in a safe preliminary orbit. As Progress passed over Russian ground stations, the Russian flight control team issued commands through the telemetry system onboard the spacecraft in an attempt to receive confirmation that navigation and rendezvous systems had deployed.

The X-band communications through DSCS and WGS allow data, photos and video to be relayed to troops on the battlefield. But WGS also brings Ka-band to the table for high-volume broadcasting to user terminals across the reception area. WGS is the Department of Defense's highest capacity communications satellite system. The satellites provide the needed capacity, coverage and connectivity in support of demanding operational scenarios for the Pentagon and allied forces around the world. Ten WGS satellites are being orbited in the Pentagon's efforts to replace the aging Defense Satellite Communication System with new technology. Each WGS has 10 times the capacity of a DSCS satellite, allowing users to process and receive data quicker than ever before.",AFETR,2015-07-24,0000-00-00

Sentinel 2A and 2B are roughly analogous to the U.S. government's Landsat satellite series, but with the ability to image the entire planet at faster tempos, a characteristic known as revisit time. SENTINEL 2B's orbit is positioned 180 degrees away from Sentinel 2A, and the satellites together will see every point on the planet at least once every five days.

The satellite was originally designed as EchoStar XIII, or CMBStar, which was intended to be used under a partnership between EchoStar and the Chinese government to provide S-band mobile video broadcasting during the 2008 Summer Olympics. The program was abandoned in April 2008, after construction was complete, when it became clear the satellite would not launch in time for the Olympics – although the reason stated for the cancellation was that performance specifications had not been met. The EchoStar XXIII satellite was ordered in 2014, to reuse the spacecraft which had been constructed for the earlier mission. The large antenna which would have served mobile users of the EchoStar XIII satellite has been replaced with four Ku-band antennae with thirty-two transponders, while the satellite is also able to offer S-band and Ka-band communications. The satellite has a design life of fifteen years and will begin its service life in an orbital slot at a longitude of 45 degrees West. However, it is able to operate in any of EchoStar’s eight geosynchronous slots allotted to Ku-band broadcasting satellites.",AFETR,2017-03-16,0000-00-00

NOAA-20 operates about 50 minutes ahead of Suomi NPP, allowing important overlap in observational coverage. Circling the Earth from pole-to-pole, it crosses the equator about 14 times daily, providing full global coverage twice a day. This will give meteorologists information on ""atmospheric temperature and moisture, clouds, sea-surface temperature, ocean color, sea ice cover, volcanic ash, and fire detection"" so as to enhance weather forecasting including hurricane tracking, post-hurricane recovery by detailing storm damage and mapping of power outages. The project incorporates five instruments, and these are substantially upgraded since previous satellite equipment. The project's greater-detailed observations will provide better predictions and emphasize climate behavior in cases like El Niño and La Nina. The project's satellite bus and Ozone Mapping and Profiler equipment, was designed by Ball Aerospace.

The mission will find exoplanets that periodically block part of the light from their host stars, events called transits. TESS will survey 200,000 of the brightest stars near the sun to search for transiting exoplanets.

TESS scientists expect the mission will catalog thousands of planet candidates and vastly increase the current number of known exoplanets. Of these, approximately 300 are expected to be Earth-sized and super-Earth-sized exoplanets, which are worlds no larger than twice the size of Earth. TESS will find the most promising exoplanets orbiting our nearest and brightest stars, giving future researchers a rich set of new targets for more comprehensive follow-up studies.

AEOLUS will gather the first comprehensive worldwide measurements of wind speed—over oceans and land masses—from Earth's surface to an altitude of nearly 100,000 feet (30 kilometers). Data collected by the AEOLUS satellite will be fed into numerical weather prediction models, replacing simulated 'boundary conditions' in the computers models with near real-time measurements from space. AEOLUS was not conceived by ESA as an operational weather satellite, but forecasters will be some of the prime beneficiaries of the mission. The mission is named for a figure in Greek mythology who was appointed by the gods as 'keeper of the winds'. AEOLUS carries a high-power ultraviolet laser fired at 50 pulses per second toward the ground. Light emitted from the laser—the centerpiece of Aeolus's single science instrument—will bounce off air molecules, aerosol and cloud particles, and Earth's surface. A tiny fraction of the scattered ultraviolet photons will reflect back toward a 5-foot (1.5-meter) telescope on the Aeolus satellite. The light will return to the Aeolus satellite's Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument—ALADIN—with a slightly different color. By analyzing the change in color caused by the motion of atmospheric air molecules—known as the Doppler effect—scientists can derive wind speeds. Researchers also intend to analyze data from Aeolus to gain a better understanding of how winds are generated, and how atmospheric currents are linked to changes in Earth's climate.",FRGUI,2018-08-22,0000-00-00

By early 2020, the 150-pound (68-kilogram) ALE-1 satellite planned to use a drag-inducing mechanism to maneuver to an orbit low enough to ensure the particles safely re-enter the atmosphere, and don’t become space junk. However one of the parts that was supposed to launch the particles is not moving properly and that it cannot get back to its designated position. This means that the launch action cannot initiate, and it is not possible to transition to the release action.

By early 2020, the 150-pound (68-kilogram) ALE-1 satellite planned to use a drag-inducing mechanism to maneuver to an orbit low enough to ensure the particles safely re-enter the atmosphere, and don’t become space junk. However one of the parts that was supposed to launch the particles is not moving properly and that it cannot get back to its designated position. This means that the launch action cannot initiate, and it is not possible to transition to the release action.

The SHIJIAN-20 satellite was launched into space by the third Long March-5 rocket, China's largest carrier rocket on Dec. 27, 2019. It has carried out orbit experiments for a series of key technologies. SJ-20 has the largest solar wings among all China's satellites, with the total wingspan 10 meters wider than that of a Boeing 737 aircraft. The solar wings has unfolded twice, and the increased solar wing area will supply the satellite with abundant power.",WSC,2019-12-27,0000-00-00

45916,DEMI,,US,"DEMI (Deformable Mirror) is a tiny military CubeSat satellite, owned by DARPA, the Pentagon’s research division, and launched from the International Space Station that will use its camera to focus on the dim, distant objects in space that usually get washed out by nearby stars or other larger objects. DeMi is drastically smaller than famous space cameras like the Hubble Space Telescope, but DARPA is counting on its ability to focus on overlooked celestial bodies to vastly improve the images scientists can capture.",TTMTR,1998-11-20,2022-03-08

46269,"CAPELLA-2 (SEQUOIA)",,US,"CAPELLA-2 (SEQUOIA) is a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite developed by Capella Space of California. The orbiter is the first publicly available satellite in what is expected to be a 36-satellite constellation that will be able to deliver synthetic aperture radar imagery of the Middle East, the Korean Peninsula, Japan, Europe, Southeast Asia, Africa and the United States. Customers for this imagery include the U.S. government.  Unlike traditional electro-optical sensors used to create satellite imagery, SAR uses radar. This gives SAR some advantages over traditional imagery, such as the ability to produce images regardless of inclement weather (cloud coverage) and whether the sun is shining. Additionally, SAR can collect data on material properties, moisture content, precise movements and elevation. Capella Space claims Sequoia and the forthcoming satellites in the constellation will be able to detect sub-0.5-meter changes on the Earth’s surface.",RLLC,2020-08-31,0000-00-00

CYGNUS NG-14 delivered 7,829 pounds (3,551 kilograms) of supplies and experiments to the Space Station. The fresh food packed inside the supply ship included prosciutto, chorizo, salami, summer sausage, brie, smoked gouda, smoked provolone, and fruits and vegetables. Among clothing and other crew provisions, the Cygnus mission delivered an upgraded toilet to the space station, allowing astronauts to test its functionality before a similar commode flies on the Orion crew capsule to the moon. Northrop Grumman named the Cygnus supply ship the ""S.S. Kalpana Chawla"" in honor of the first woman of Indian descent to fly into space. ",WLPIS,2020-10-03,2021-01-26

48803,"TIANZHOU 2",,PRC,"TIANZHOU-2 is a mission of the Tianzhou-class unmanned cargo spacecraft. The spacecraft successfully docked with the Tiangong space station. It is a part of the construction of the Tiangong space station, and is the first cargo resupply mission to the already launched Tianhe core module (CCM). Although it has not been made clear yet if Tianzhou 2 will remain on the station for the duration or any of Shenzhou 12's stay on the station, it is a possibility as the CCM has more than one docking port as opposed to China's two previous space stations.",WSC,2021-05-29,2022-03-31

49220,INSPIRATION-4,,US,"INSPIRATION-4 is a human spaceflight mission, operated by SpaceX on behalf of Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman. The mission launched on 16 September 2021 from the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A atop a twice-flown Falcon 9 launch vehicle, injecting the Dragon capsule into low Earth orbit. The mission aims to complete the first orbital spaceflight with only private citizens aboard, as part of an effort to raise awareness for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Four crew members; Hayley Arceneaux, Christopher Sembroski, Sian Proctor, and Isaacman himself will spend three days in orbit aboard Crew Dragon Resilience, which was outfitted with a cupola unique to this flight in place of a docking hatch. The flight is in orbit at an altitude of 585 km (364 mi), a height that has not been achieved since STS-125 in 2009.

50463,JWST,,ESA,"JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) is a space telescope developed by NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 and played an integral role in the Apollo program. It is intended to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope as NASA's flagship mission in astrophysics. JWST was launched on 25 December 2021 on Ariane flight VA256. It is designed to provide improved infrared resolution and sensitivity over Hubble, and will enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, including observations of some of the most distant events and objects in the Universe such as the formation of the first galaxies, and allowing detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.

52086,"SOYUZ MS-21",,CIS,"SOYUZ MS-21 is a Russian Soyuz spaceflight to the International Space Station (ISS) with a crew of three launched from Baikonur on 18 March 2022. The three-Russian member crew were: Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev, Sergey Korsakov. The arriving cosmonauts at the station have gained particular international attention after entering in bright yellow suits with blue elements, having changed before and after into different suits. International commentators saw in these colors the national colors of Ukraine and interpreted the personal choice of suits by the cosmonauts as a sign of their sympathy for Ukraine in the light of the parallel ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, which strained also space cooperation such as the ISS program after international sanctions on Russia. The cosmonauts said when asked about the colors that the yellow suits needed to be used, and Roscosmos followed with a statement that the colors are to be read as the identifying colors of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which all three cosmonauts graduated from.",TTMTR,2022-03-18,2022-09-29
