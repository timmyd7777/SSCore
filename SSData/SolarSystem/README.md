Solar System Object Data
========================

This directory contains essential data on Solar System objects in various formats.  These files exit primarily for testing SSCore import/export functionality, but may be generally useful in their own right.

You may use this data free of charge for any purpose as you see fit.  If it's helpful to you, drop me a note!

Planets.csv
-----------

This table of data on the Sun, the major planets, and Pluto is in Southern Stars CSV format was adapted from Table 1 in this paper by E.M. Standish (JPL Solar System Dynamics), ["Keplerian Elements for Approximate Positions of the Major Planets"](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/p_elem_t1.txt) and from JPL's ["Planets and Pluto: Physical Characteristics"](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?planet_phys_par) table.  Data for the Sun is from NASA's ["Sun Fact Sheet"](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html).

Columns are: Type, q, e, i, w, N, M, n, Epoch, H, G, Radius, Mass, RotPer, Albedo, ID, Name

- **_Type_** (PL) means planet
- **_q_** is perihelion distance (AU)
- **_e_** is eccentricity
- **_i_** is inclination (deg)
- **_w_** is argument of perihelion (deg)
- **_N_** is longitude of ascending node (deg)
- **_M_** is mean anomaly (deg)
- **_n_** is mean motion (deg/day)
- **_Epoch_** is epoch of orbital elements (Julian Ephemeris Date)

- **_G_** is magnitude phase parameter
- **_Radius_** is equatorial radius (km)
- **_Mass_** is planetary mass (kg)
- **_RotPer_** is sidereal rotation period (days); negative if retrograde

Moons.csv
---------

This table of moon data in Southern Stars CSV format was adapted from JPL's ["Planetary Satellite Mean Orbital Parameters"](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_elem) and from JPL's ["Planetary Satellite Physical Parameters"](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_phys_par) table. Rotation periods are from the [2015 Report](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Docs/WGCCRE/WGCCRE2015reprint) of the IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements. 

Additional data for all confirmed moons of [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Jupiter) and [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Saturn) as of 2023 were added from Wikipedia, and from Scott Sheppard's tables of satellite data for [Jupiter](https://sites.google.com/carnegiescience.edu/sheppard/moons/jupitermoons?authuser=0) and [Saturn](https://sites.google.com/carnegiescience.edu/sheppard/moons/saturnmoons?authuser=0), bringing the grand total to 216 solar system moons. 

Columns are identical to Planets.csv, above.

The orbital inclinations, arguments, and nodes are referred to their Laplace Plane (essentially their primary planet's equatorial plane), except for Earth's Moon, whose orbital elements are referred to the J2000 ecliptic.

This table of asteroid data in MPC Export Format was compiled from the [Minor Planet Center](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/mpc.html).  It includes the first 10,000 numbered asteroids from the [MPCORB database](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/MPCORB/MPCORB.DAT) and all of the asteroids on the MPC's ["Distant"  objects](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/MPCORB/Distant.txt) list.  This file includes all of the officially IAU-designated dwarf planets.  The file format is described [here](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/info/MPOrbitFormat.html).

DE438
-----

This directory contains the [JPL DE438](ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ascii/de438/) planetary and lunar ephemeris, converted from ASCII to binary format using Bill Gray's [asc2eph](https://github.com/Bill-Gray/jpl_eph) utility (see documentation from [Project Pluto](https://www.projectpluto.com/jpl_eph.htm#asc2eph).).  The binary files are in little-endian (Intel/ARM) byte order.

There are two files here.  The larger, **1550_2650.438**, is about 103 MB in size and covers the entire thousand-year DE438 timespan.  The smaller file, **1950_2040.438**, is a 9.4 MB subset which convers the years 1950 to 2050 - the entire space age!

- **_timezone_**:  the iana timezone id (see file timeZone.txt) varchar(40)

- **_timezone_raw_offset_**:  GMT offset, independent of daylight saving time

Except for the last two columns, the column description is copied from the [GeoNames ReadMe](http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt).
